# Replit Workflows – Log Simulator

A Replit project that demonstrates **Replit Workspace Workflows** and provides a **Streamlit log and error simulator** for testing log pipelines or analytics dashboards.

> **Note:** The folder name "Git workflow" refers to this being a workflow demo on Replit. It is not a Git branching or pull-request workflow.

## Features

- **Replit Workflows** – Run button starts the app via a configured workflow (shell task → Streamlit → webview).
- **Log simulation** – Continuously generates sample log lines (e.g. "Processing request from client", "Database query executed successfully") with timestamps.
- **Error injection** – Inject predefined errors on demand to simulate failures:
  - NullPointerException
  - ConnectionTimeoutError
  - OutOfMemoryError
  - FileNotFoundException
  - AuthenticationError
  - PermissionDenied
- **Live log view** – Scrollable stream of INFO (green) and ERROR (red) entries; keeps the last 100 lines.

## How to Run

### On Replit

1. Open the project in Replit.
2. Click **Run** (or use the configured workflow). The "Project" workflow starts the "Streamlit App" workflow, which runs Streamlit and opens the app in a webview on port 5000.

### Locally

```bash
# From this folder
pip install streamlit   # or: uv sync
streamlit run app.py --server.port 5000
```

Then open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

## Workflows (.replit)

| Workflow       | Mode     | Description |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **Project**    | parallel | Top-level; runs the "Streamlit App" workflow. |
| **Streamlit App** | —     | Runs `streamlit run app.py --server.port 5000`, waits for port 5000, opens webview. |

Deployment is set to **autoscale** with the same run command.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.11+
- Streamlit (see `pyproject.toml`)

## Use Cases

- Demo Replit Workflows (run → shell → webview).
- Generate fake logs and errors for testing the [Replit-DataApp](https://github.com/Allen-John-Manoj/Replit-DataApp) or other log analytics tools.
- Simulate exception types when building automation or remediation workflows.
